## Part 5 — ATS Edges (Elite 8 & Final Four)

### Elite 8 ATS

| Edge | Record | Action |
|------|--------|--------|
| **5-seeds in Elite 8** | 8-1 ATS since 1985 | Auto-buy — best bet in tournament |
| **All Elite 8 underdogs** | 80-60-2 ATS (57%) all-time | Lean underdogs |
| **Fade Elite 8 favorites under 5 pts** | 1-10-1 ATS (9%) recent | Strong fade signal |
| **1-seeds in Elite 8** | 23-30-4 ATS (43.4%) since 2001 | Fade on spread |
| **Cinderella/non-power teams in E8** | 15-10-1 ATS (60%) since 2003 | Bet the mid-major |

## Part 6 — What Separates Final Four from Sweet 16 (The Delta)

| Delta | Sweet 16 Teams | Final Four Teams |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| KenPom Rank | Top 5-40 | Top 1-15 |
| AdjEM | +18 to +28 | +25 to +36 |
| AdjO Rank | 15-60 | 5-30 |
| AdjD Rank | 10-55 | 5-30 |
| Both O+D top 30 | Uncommon | Near-universal |
| Effective FG% | 20-80 | 5-40 |
| Free throw rate | Variable | Top 30 |

**The 7 Critical Separators:**

1. **Two-way efficiency gap** — Final Four teams are top 20 in BOTH AdjO and AdjD. Sweet 16 teams often rank 40-80 on one side.
2. **AdjEM above +25** — The structural breakpoint. Below +20 is a long shot for Final Four regardless of seed.
3. **Consistent winning margin** — Champions win by a lot (UConn 2024: 23.3 avg margin). Teams surviving close games eventually lose one.
4. **Free throw generation** — All 6 champions were top-25 in free throw attempt rate. Getting to the line absorbs variance in close games.
5. **Interior presence or defensive scheme** — Every champion had a dominant big, elite paint control, or comprehensive defensive system.
6. **Schedule-tested résumé** — 23 of last 24 champions had SOS inside the top 33. Weak schedules do not prepare teams for back-to-back elite opponents.
7. **Proven head coach** — Every 2019-2025 champion was coached by a multiple-tournament-appearance veteran (Bennett, Drew, Self, Hurley x2, Golden).
