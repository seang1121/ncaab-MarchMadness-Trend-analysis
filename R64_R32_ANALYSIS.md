### 2025 — Quietest R32 in Window, Only 1 Upset

> After a chalk first round, R32 was almost entirely predictable. Only Arkansas (10) upsetting St. John's (2) qualified as a true upset. BYU advanced over Wisconsin in what some classified as a mid-level result.

**Round of 32 Results** (confirmed results)

| Winner Seed | Winner Team | Loser Seed | Loser Team | Score |
|-------------|-------------|------------|------------|-------|

St. John's shot just 28% from the field and 2-of-22 from three. Four 1-seeds reached the Sweet 16, and the average Sweet 16 seed was among the lowest in years.

| 16 | ~1 of 24 | ~0 | 0% (FDU lost in R32 to Florida Atlantic 9-seed) |

**Key observation:** The three 15-seeds that survived R64 (Oral Roberts, Saint Peter's, Princeton) all also won their R32 game — then lost in the Sweet 16. 13 and 14-seeds that advance are 0-for in Round of 32 in this window. 11-seeds that win R1 have been dominant in R32.

## Part 4 — Conference Performance

### Round of 64 — Average Teams Per Conference (Per Year)

| Conference | Avg Bids/Year | Avg R64 Wins/Year | R64 Win % | Notes |
|------------|--------------|-------------------|------------|-------|
| Big Ten | 8-9 | 6-7 | ~80% | 8-0 in 2025 (record) |
| SEC | 8-9 | 6-7 | ~78% | 8-0 in 2025 (matched record) |
| ACC | 7-8 | 5-6 | ~73% | Historically most tournament-tested |
| Big 12 | 7-8 | 5-6 | ~72% | Strong depth but inconsistent R64 |
| Big East | 5-7 | 4-5 | ~76% | Higher quality per bid than quantity |
| WCC | 2-3 | 1-2 | ~60% | Gonzaga carries; no depth |
| American Athletic | 3-4 | 2 | ~55% | Houston usually earns bid |
| Pac-12 | 4-6 | 3 | ~60% | 2021 was aberration (4 Sweet 16) |
| Mountain West | 2-3 | 1-2 | ~55% | SDSU most consistent |
| Mid-Majors (all others) | 15-20 | 4-6 | ~25-30% | Occasional upsets, rarely survives |

**Conference R32 advancement by year (notable data):**
- 2025: Big Ten went 8-0 in R64 and largely dominated R32; Big East went 4-5 overall
- 2024: SEC struggled (3-5 in R64 after Kentucky's loss); Big East dominated with all 3 teams surviving to Sweet 16
- 2023: All four 1-seeds eliminated before Elite 8 for first time — no single conference dominance
- 2021: Pac-12 had 4 Sweet 16 teams — historically unique outlier
- 2019: ACC led with 5 Sweet 16 teams

### Which Conferences Punch Below Their Seed in R64

| Conference | Observation |
|------------|-------------|
| SEC | Historically strong in regular season but has had notable upsets (Kentucky 2022 as 2-seed to Saint Peter's) |
| Big 12 | Kansas (1-seed) lost to 8-seed Arkansas in 2023 — blue bloods are not immune |
| Power conferences overall | Still produce ~70%+ of all R32 teams — the field correlation is extremely high |
| Mid-majors | Win about 25-30% of R64 games but almost never advance past R32 (see 11/12-seed exception) |

## Part 5 — ATS Edges

### Round of 64 ATS

| Edge | Record/Data | Action | Confidence |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| **11-seeds vs 6-seeds** | 63.5% ATS since 2009; 74-52-2 (59%) since 2005 | Auto-lean underdog | Very High |
| **Fade small chalk (-1 to -3 favorites)** | 39.5% ATS since 2009 | Never bet small chalk in R64 | Very High |
| **Overall underdogs in R64** | 52.8% ATS since 2015 (149-133-3) | Lean underdog side | High |
| **12-seeds vs 5-seeds ATS** | 63.2% ATS over last 5 tournaments; 15-13 ATS since 2017 | Strong underdog lean | High |
| **1-seeds vs 16-seeds** | Massive favorites; 16-seeds actually cover ~40-45% ATS despite 2% SU win rate | Avoid laying 20+ pts on 1-seeds in R64 | Moderate |
| **8/9 seed games** | Near-coin flip SU; moderate chalk lean ATS (higher seed usually -1 to -3) | Falls into small chalk dead zone — avoid | Moderate |
| **5-seeds after big regular season win total** | Historically weak ATS performers in R64 — 12-seeds specifically target them | Add as fade signal | Moderate |
| **Conference tournament champion vs at-large** | Conference tournament champions win R64 games at slightly higher rate (built-in momentum signal) | Minor positive bias for tournament champs | Low |

### Round of 32 ATS

| Edge | Record/Data | Action | Confidence |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| **Fade R1 Cinderellas (12-15 seeds) in R32** | 0-10 ATS since 1998 for 12-15 seeds that won R1; lose by avg 14.8 PPG | Auto-fade Cinderellas in R32 | Very High |
| **Favorites in R32** | 68.75% ATS in 2024; general chalk lean | Back favorites in R32 | High |
| **1-seed favorites in R32** | ~85-90% SU win rate, cover most of the time too | Lean 1-seeds to cover in R32 | High |
| **Top-6 seeds that won R64 by 3 or fewer pts** | 10-16 SU in R32 — 38% win rate; shaky | Fade close first-round winners | Moderate |
| **Teams winning R64 by 20+** | 66-28 SU in R32 but only 39-54 ATS vs opponents who didn't dominate | Strong SU, fade on spread | Moderate |
| **Double-digit seeds vs 5-7-seed opponents in R32** | 5-21 SU, 8-15-3 ATS (34.8%) | Fade Cinderellas facing 5-7 seeds | High |
| **Double-digit vs double-digit in R32** | 12-2 SU and ATS for better seed since 2001 | Take the better seed when 2 double-digits meet | High |
| **11-seeds in R32 after winning R1** | ~71% Sweet 16 rate in this window — these aren't flukes | Take 11-seeds who won R1 to also cover R32 | Moderate |

## Part 6 — Cinderella Profile (First Round Winners, Seeds 12–15)

Every team seeded 12-15 that won a Round of 64 game from 2019-2025, their profile, and what happened in Round of 32:

| Year | Team | Seed | Conference | R64 Win | R32 Result | Made Sweet 16? |
|------|------|------|------------|---------|------------|----------------|
| 2019 | Murray State | 12 | Ohio Valley | def. Marquette 83-64 | Lost to Florida State 62-90 | No — blowout loss |
| 2019 | Oregon | 12 | Pac-12 | def. Wisconsin 72-54 | def. UC Irvine 73-54 | YES — power conf |
| 2019 | UC Irvine | 13 | Big West | def. Kansas State 70-64 | Lost to Oregon 54-73 | No |
| 2021 | Oral Roberts | 15 | Summit League | def. Ohio State 75-72 | def. Florida 81-78 | YES — historic |
| 2021 | Oregon State | 12 | Pac-12 | def. Tennessee 70-56 | def. Oklahoma State 80-70 | YES — power conf |
| 2021 | Abilene Christian | 14 | Southland | def. Texas 53-52 | Lost to UCLA 47-67 | No |
| 2021 | North Texas | 13 | Conference USA | def. Purdue 78-69 | Lost to Villanova 61-84 | No |
| 2021 | Ohio | 13 | MAC | def. Virginia 62-58 | Lost to Creighton 58-72 | No |
| 2022 | Saint Peter's | 15 | MAAC | def. Kentucky 85-79 OT | def. Murray State 70-60 | YES — historic |
| 2022 | New Mexico State | 12 | WAC | def. UConn 70-63 | Lost to Arkansas 48-53 | No |
| 2022 | Richmond | 12 | A-10 | def. Iowa 67-63 | Lost to Providence 51-79 | No |
| 2023 | Princeton | 15 | Ivy League | def. Arizona 59-55 | def. Missouri 78-63 | YES — 4th ever |
| 2023 | Furman | 13 | Southern | def. Virginia 68-67 | Lost to San Diego State 52-75 | No |
| 2024 | James Madison | 12 | Sun Belt | def. Wisconsin 72-61 | Lost to Duke 55-93 | No — blowout |
| 2024 | Oakland | 14 | Horizon | def. Kentucky 80-76 OT | Lost to NC State 73-79 | No |
| 2024 | Grand Canyon | 12 | WAC | def. Saint Mary's 77-66 | Lost to Alabama 61-72 | No |
| 2025 | McNeese State | 12 | Southland | def. Clemson 69-67 | Lost (R32) | No |
| 2025 | Colorado State | 12 | Mountain West | def. Memphis 78-70 | Lost (R32) | No |

**Cinderella R2 Pattern:**
- 6 of 18 (33%) Cinderellas (12-15 seeds) survived to Sweet 16
- Of those 6, four were power conference programs (Oregon, Oregon State, and one other) or historic exceptions (Oral Roberts, Saint Peter's, Princeton)
- 12-15 seeds from non-power, non-mid-major conferences: 0-for in reaching Sweet 16 in this window (except the three noted historic exceptions)
- **ATS in R32 after R1 win: 0-10 ATS since 1998** — the market overreacts to Cinderella stories

**Cinderella Success Profile (the ones that survived):**
- Oral Roberts 2021: KenPom top-50, elite offense, veteran roster, slow tempo equalizer
- Saint Peter's 2022: Elite zone defense, extreme tempo control, Shaheen Holloway coaching
- Princeton 2023: Princeton system offense, veteran roster, Ivy League record-holders
- Oregon (12) 2019: Power conference Pac-12 — basically mis-seeded, not a true Cinderella
- Oregon State (12) 2021: Power conference Pac-12 — hot streak entering tournament
- All three: Slow tempo, elite defense, upperclassman-heavy, either power conference or elite profile mid-major

## Part 7 — Totals Analysis (Over/Under)

### Round of 64 Totals

| Year | Under Rate | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| 2019 | ~52-55% Under | Near-average; chalk-heavy draws reduced pace variance |
| 2021 | ~58% Under | COVID bubble created unusual defensive intensity |
| 2022 | ~60% Under | Tournament coaching cautiousness; pace slows in March |
| 2023 | ~67% Under | Historically low scoring; over ROI was deeply negative all weekend |
| 2024 | ~62% Under | Under hit at high rate especially in blowouts |
| 2025 | ~60% Under | Chalk-heavy slate, few close games, Under prevailed |

**Combined historical (since 2018 per BetMGM research):** Over is 132-177 (42.7%) in all tournament games.

### Round of 32 Totals

| Trend | Data | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| Under general trend | 63-67% since 2021 | Teams have 2 rounds of film; defense improves |
| Top-4 seeds after narrow R64 win | 34-23-3 Under (59.6%) | Won close game, opponents are now scouted |
| R32 pace reduction | Consistent | Coaches become more conservative after surviving R64 |
| Blowout risk | High | 1-seeds especially create lopsided scoring games that suppress Overs |
| Market adjustment | Totals still set near regular-season pace | Creates sustained Under value |

**Totals Model Recommendation:**
- R64: Lean Under as base, especially in games with a 1, 2, or 3-seed — defensive preparation is maximized
- R32: Strong Under lean; teams have seen each other now, coaching adjustments dominate
- Exception: High-pace programs (above 75 possessions/game) playing each other — consider market

---

## Part 8 — What Does NOT Predict R64/R32 Success

| Factor | Why It Fails |
|--------|-------------|
| **Regular season point differential vs weak SOS** | A team that feasts on bad opponents has no tournament résumé — Cinderellas from weak conferences often come in 25-7 but rank outside top-60 KenPom |
| **Upset bracket history / historical seed matchup** | The 12/5 upset rate is real as a population, but individual games require much more analysis — don't bet 12-seeds blindly |
| **Blue Blood brand** | 2023: Kansas (1-seed) lost in R32. Virginia (4-seed) lost in R64 to Furman. Duke missed the Sweet 16. Brand is already in the line. |
| **National ranking (AP/Coaches Poll)** | Not predictive as a standalone. Preseason #1 has historically underperformed in tournament. |
| **Conference regular season record** | Conference records tell you conference skill level, not national readiness |
| **Momentum-only narrative** | "Hot teams" fail as often as cold ones in R64 — game-to-game variance is high |
| **R64 winning margin as R32 predictor** | Teams winning by 20+ in R64 cover only 39-54 ATS in R32 when facing opponents who won their R64 game close |
| **Double-digit seed surviving R1 = keep betting them** | The data is unambiguous: 0-10 ATS since 1998 for 12-15 seeds in R32 |

---

## Part 9 — Recommendations for Betting Model

### R64 Model Triggers

| Situation | Action | Confidence Level |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| 11-seed vs 6-seed | Take 11-seed ATS | Very High |
| Favorite between -1 and -3 in R64 | Avoid or lean underdog | Very High |
| 12-seed in good matchup (slow tempo, defensive, vs run-and-gun 5-seed) | Lean 12-seed ATS | High |
| 5-seed that is high-tempo/offense-only | Flag as 12-seed upset candidate | High |
| True mid-major 15-seed with veteran roster + top-40 defense | Small lean toward upset potential | Moderate |
| 1-seed favored by 20+ | Fade on spread (take 16-seed ATS) | Moderate |
| 8 vs 9 game | Avoid — falls in small chalk dead zone | High (avoid signal) |
| Power conference 11-seed | Lean ATS — these are mis-seeds, not Cinderellas | High |
| R64 game total with 1/2/3-seed | Lean Under | High |

### R64 Cinderella Identification Checklist

Before betting on a double-digit seed in R64:
- [ ] KenPom top-60 overall? (non-power must be top-60)
- [ ] AdjD top-40 nationally?
- [ ] Tempo below 70 possessions/game?
- [ ] Won conference tournament (not just at-large)?
- [ ] Upperclassman roster (2+ seniors in rotation)?
- [ ] Positive turnover margin?

If 4+ boxes checked: consider the double-digit seed ATS. If fewer than 3: only bet if the spread is a clear dead-zone small chalk spot.

### R32 Model Triggers

| Situation | Action | Confidence Level |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| Any 12-15 seed playing in R32 after R1 win | Fade them ATS — 0-10 since 1998 | Very High |
| 1-seed in R32 | Take the favorite; they cover ~85% | High |
| Cinderella (12-15) facing 5-7 seed | Strong fade — 5-21 SU in this spot | Very High |
| Two double-digit seeds in R32 | Take the better seed (12-2 SU and ATS) | High |
| Team that won R64 by 3 or fewer points | Fade — only 38% SU in R32 | Moderate |
| 11-seed that won R1 | Can continue to cover — most are power conference mis-seeds | Moderate |
| R32 game total | Lean Under across the board | High |
| Top-4 seed after close R64 win | Strong Under in their R32 game (59.6%) | High |

## Part 11 — Efficiency Profile Comparison: R64/R32 Teams vs Elite 8

> Research compiled from KenPom data for all 48 Elite 8 teams (2019–2025). Comparison establishes how much a team needs to "look like" an Elite 8 team when they enter as a R64/R32 seed.

### Statistical Separator by Round

| Metric | Typical R64 Team | Typical R32 Team | Typical Sweet 16 Team | Elite 8 Average | Elite 8 (excl. Cinderellas) |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| **KenPom Rank** | ~40–55 | ~22–32 | ~15–22 | **14.6** | **9.5** |
| **AdjEM** | ~+14 to +16 | ~+19 to +21 | ~+23 to +25 | **+25.1** | **+25.9** |
| **AdjO Rank** | ~42–50 | ~28–38 | ~20–30 | **~17.4** | **~16.5** |
| **AdjD Rank** | ~40–55 | ~25–40 | ~18–30 | **~21.3** | **~17.9** |
| **% in KenPom Top 20** | ~30% | ~55% | ~70% | **87.5%** | **95%** |
| **% in KenPom Top 15** | ~15% | ~35% | ~50% | **75%** | **88%** |
| **% with AdjD Top 30** | ~25% | ~45% | ~65% | **72.9%** | **82%** |
| **% with AdjD Top 50** | ~45% | ~70% | ~85% | **87.5%** | **95%** |
| **% with AdjO Top 30** | ~30% | ~50% | ~68% | **70.8%** | **80%** |

**Bottom line:** The Elite 8 average KenPom rank is **14.6** — about the same as a #2 or #3 seed. Without Cinderella outliers it's **9.5**. This is the target efficiency profile for a legitimate Final Four team.

### "Magic Cutoff" Points — Minimum Thresholds by Round

| Metric | R64 Baseline | R32 Baseline | Sweet 16 Baseline | Elite 8 Baseline | Elite 8 (No Cinderella) |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| **KenPom Rank** | ~35–50 | ~20–30 | ~12–20 | **Top 20** | **Top 15** |
| **AdjEM** | +8 to +10 | +14 to +16 | +22 to +24 | **+20+** (90% of teams) | **+24+** |
| **AdjD Rank** | ~40–55 | ~25–40 | ~18–30 | **Top 30** (73%) | **Top 25** (83%) |
| **AdjO Rank** | ~42–50 | ~28–38 | ~20–30 | **Top 30** (71%) | **Top 25** (80%) |

### Year-by-Year Elite 8 Efficiency Averages

| Year | Avg KenPom | Avg AdjEM | Avg AdjD Rank | Field Type | Notes |
|------|------------|-----------|---------------|------------|-------|
| 2019 | **6.1** | **+27.5** | ~13.5 | Traditional chalk | All 8 teams inside top 13; no Cinderellas |
| 2021 | 11.9 | +25.8 | ~18.6 | COVID outlier | Oregon State (#35) and UCLA (#17) as surprise entries |
| 2022 | 29.6* | +19.7* | ~36.3* | Highest variance | Saint Peter's (#128) inflates all averages; excl. SPU = 12.7 KenPom, +21.9 AdjEM |
| 2023 | 19.5* | +22.4* | ~24.3 | Balanced | Princeton (#93) is the outlier; other 7 teams avg top 10 |
| 2024 | 14.0* | +23.6* | ~24.8* | Near-chalk | NC State (#49) is the outlier; other 7 teams avg top 10 |
| 2025 | **6.4** | **+31.7** | **~10.5** | Historic peak | All 8 teams inside top 15 — unprecedented; strongest Elite 8 ever assembled |

*Skewed by Cinderella outliers

### Cinderella Floor: Who Can Reach Elite 8 from Outside Top 35?

Only **3 of 48 teams (6.25%)** reached the Elite 8 from outside the KenPom top 35 since 2019:

| Team | Year | Seed | KenPom | AdjEM | AdjD | AdjO | How They Got There |
|------|------|------|--------|-------|------|------|-------------------|
| Saint Peter's | 2022 | 15 | ~128 | +5.0 | ~28 | ~130 | Zone defense + Kentucky's defensive weakness; 3 straight games under 4-pt margin |
| Princeton | 2023 | 15 | ~93 | +9.5 | ~13 | ~90 | Elite defense (#13 nationally) in a grind identity; Arizona held to 55 pts |
| NC State | 2024 | 11 | 49 | +14.2 | ~38 | ~48 | Won ACC Tournament; balanced profile; beat 4 top-25 teams in a row |

**Takeaway:** Sub-top-35 Elite 8 appearances happen **once per tournament on average**, always with seeds 11–15, always with either elite defense OR a balanced efficiency profile at the low end.

## Part 12 — The Three Cinderella Archetypes (Efficiency Profiles)

> Every upset team from 2019–2025 fits one of three profiles. The profile tells you how far they can go, not just whether they can win R64.

### Archetype 1: Defense-First (AdjD Significantly Better Than AdjO)

Teams where AdjD rank is 50+ spots better than AdjO rank.

| Team | Year | Seed | AdjD | AdjO | AdjEM | Deepest Round | Notes |
|------|------|------|------|------|-------|---------------|-------|
| Saint Peter's | 2022 | 15 | ~28 | ~130 | +8.0 | **Elite Eight** | AdjD #28 = all-time best for 15-seed; carried to E8 |
| Princeton | 2023 | 15 | ~13 | ~90 | +9.5 | Sweet 16 | AdjD #13 = single best defense of any 15-seed ever |
| UC Irvine | 2019 | 13 | ~35 | ~120 | +10.0 | Round of 32 | #1 nationally in 2-point defense |
| Abilene Christian | 2021 | 14 | ~30 | ~155 | +5.0 | Round of 32 | #1 in turnovers forced/game; won 53-52 on defensive identity |
| North Texas | 2021 | 13 | ~40–50 | ~75 | +12.0 | Round of 32 | Slow-tempo grind; strong D kept Purdue in range |

**Maximum depth: Elite Eight.** Saint Peter's AdjD #28 is the ceiling for defense-first teams. The pattern: elite defense keeps games close (covering ATS even in losses), but eventually gets exposed when facing opponents with both elite AdjO and AdjD.

**ATS implication:** Defense-first teams keep margins tight → cover the spread even when they lose. Most reliable ATS plays at any seed.

---

### Archetype 2: Balanced (Both AdjO and AdjD Inside Top 60)

Teams where neither side of the ball is a liability.

| Team | Year | Seed | AdjO | AdjD | AdjEM | Deepest Round | Notes |
|------|------|------|------|------|-------|---------------|-------|
| FAU | 2023 | 9 | ~40 | ~30 | +19.0 | **Final Four** | #17 KenPom overall; misseeded; reached Final Four |
| NC State | 2024 | 11 | ~48 | ~38 | +14.2 | **Final Four** | Won ACC Tournament; beat UConn twice; relentless |
| Loyola Chicago | 2018 | 11 | ~55 | ~17 | ~+14 | **Final Four** | Best balanced underdog profile before this study window |
| Oregon | 2019 | 12 | ~50 | ~60 | +16.0 | Sweet 16 | Power conference (Pac-12); not a true Cinderella |
| Colorado State | 2025 | 12 | ~50 | ~45 | +17.3 | Round of 32+ | Ranked above opponent in KenPom — committee error |
| Drake | 2025 | 11 | ~55 | ~50 | +15.3 | Round of 32+ | Same: ranked above Missouri overall |

**Maximum depth: Final Four.** Every documented underdog Final Four team had a balanced profile with AdjEM +14 or higher and both AdjO/AdjD inside top 60. **This is the only archetype capable of reaching the Final Four.**

**ATS implication:** Balanced teams are the most dangerous ATS plays when spread is large — they can beat teams outright.

---

### Archetype 3: Offense-First (AdjO Significantly Better Than AdjD)

Teams where AdjO rank is 50+ spots better than AdjD rank.

| Team | Year | Seed | AdjO | AdjD | AdjEM | Deepest Round | Notes |
|------|------|------|------|------|-------|---------------|-------|
| Oral Roberts | 2021 | 15 | ~25 | ~285 | +4.0 | Round of 32 | ONLY 15-seed to win on pure offense; lost in R32 when defense was exposed |
| Grand Canyon | 2024 | 12 | ~75 | ~90 | +9.0 | Round of 32 | Slight offense edge; lost to Alabama |

**Maximum depth: Round of 32.** Offense-first teams can win R64 matchups (especially if opponent defense is also weak) but exit in R32 when facing teams with both good offense AND defense. **One-round specialists only.**

**ATS implication:** Don't bet offense-first teams to cover in R32 — they get exposed.

---

### Cinderella Depth Chart (What Gets You How Far)

| Profile | AdjEM Range | AdjD Range | Max Typical Depth | ATS Reliability |
|---------|-------------|------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Defense-First | +5 to +12 | Top 13–40 | Sweet 16 / Elite 8 | High — keeps games close |
| Balanced | +14 to +19 | Top 25–55 | **Final Four** | Very High — beats teams outright |
| Offense-First | +4 to +12 | Outside top 100 | Round of 32 | Low in R32 |

---

### The Favorite's Defensive Weakness: Most Actionable Upset Trigger

When a favored team has a **weaker AdjD than expected for their seeding**, the upset probability multiplies significantly. This was the most consistent signal across all 6 years:

| Year | Favorite | Seed | AdjD Rank | Expected AdjD | Underdog | Result |
|------|----------|------|-----------|---------------|----------|--------|
| 2021 | Ohio State | 2 | ~79 | Top 20–30 | Oral Roberts (15) | Oral Roberts wins |
| 2022 | Kentucky | 2 | Weak for 2-seed | Top 20–30 | Saint Peter's (15) | SPU wins 85-79 OT |
| 2024 | Kentucky | 3 | **~109** | Top 25–40 | Oakland (14) | Oakland wins |
| 2024 | Auburn | 4 | Vulnerable | Top 30–50 | Yale (13) | Yale wins 78-76 |

**Kentucky appeared twice as an upset victim due to recurring defensive vulnerabilities — a systematic scouting red flag for the tournament.**

### Estimated Upset Probability Multiplier by Favorite's AdjD Weakness

| Favorite Seed | Normal AdjD | Weak AdjD Threshold | Multiplier | Underdog Cover Rate |
|---------------|-------------|--------------------|-----------|--------------------|
| 1-seed | Top 5–20 | Outside top 30 | 2.5× baseline | +10% |

## Part 13 — Enhanced Betting Model: Efficiency-Adjusted Triggers

> Combines ATS history with efficiency profiles for the most complete pre-tournament betting framework available for R64/R32.

### Tier System: How to Classify Any Tournament Team

**Tier 1 — Champion Profile (KenPom Top 10, AdjEM +26+, AdjO top 15, AdjD top 15)**
- ~7–10% of the 68-team field
- 85%+ reach Elite 8
- 35%+ win championship
- All 6 recent champions met these criteria at tournament time

**Tier 2 — Legitimate Contender (KenPom Top 25, AdjEM +20–25, AdjO top 30, AdjD top 30)**
- ~25–30% of the field
- 50–65% reach Elite 8 from R64
- Sweet 16 baseline

**Tier 3 — R32 Likely, Sweet 16 Possible (KenPom Top 50, AdjEM +14–20, AdjO top 45, AdjD top 45)**
- ~40% of the field
- R32 is the expected floor; Sweet 16 requires upset or bracket luck

**Pretender Zone (KenPom Outside Top 50, AdjEM below +14)**
- ~25% of the field
- Win R64 occasionally on ATS value, but exit in R32 nearly every time
- Exception: Defense-first teams with AdjD top 40 (Saint Peter's, UC Irvine type)

### KenPom Upset Probability Matrix by Seed Matchup

| Underdog Seed | KenPom Range | Upset Rate | ATS Cover Rate | Notes |
|---------------|-------------|-----------|---------------|-------|
| **12-seed vs 5** | KenPom top 50 | ~55–65% | ~65%+ | Not really an upset; committee seeding error |
| **12-seed vs 5** | KenPom 51–75 | ~40–50% | ~55% | Strong candidate; double baseline 35% |
| **12-seed vs 5** | KenPom 76–100 | ~30–35% | ~50% | Historical baseline; still covers often |
| **12-seed vs 5** | KenPom 100+ | ~15–25% | ~40% | Needs opponent defensive weakness |
| **13-seed vs 4** | KenPom top 75 | ~25–35% | ~50% | Legitimate; needs defensive excellence |
| **14-seed vs 3** | KenPom top 100 | ~10–15% | ~45% | Usually needs weak favorite defense |
| **15-seed vs 2** | KenPom top 110 | ~5–10% | ~40% | Saint Peter's 107 = historical ceiling |
| **11-seed vs 6** | KenPom top 50 | ~50–60% | ~63%+ | Historically the best R64 underdog bet |

**Critical 12-seed rule:** If the 12-seed's overall KenPom rank is **higher than the 5-seed** (a KenPom inversion), treat the 12-seed as the de facto favorite — cover rate jumps to 60%+. This happened in 2025 (Colorado State #44 > Memphis #50; McNeese #58 > Clemson #75).

### ATS Decision Tree: R64 Evaluation Framework

```
Step 1: Is there a KenPom inversion (lower seed ranked higher overall)?
→ YES: Bet underdog — 60%+ cover rate
→ NO: Continue

Step 2: Does the underdog have AdjD inside top 40?
→ YES: Defense-first or balanced Cinderella candidate — lean underdog ATS
→ NO: Continue

Step 3: Does the favorite have AdjD WEAKER than expected for their seed?
→ YES: Upset multiplier 1.3–2.5×; lean underdog ATS even without AdjD edge
→ NO: Continue

Step 4: Is the favorite a small chalk (-1 to -3)?
→ YES: Do not bet the favorite — 39.5% ATS historical record in this range
→ NO: Continue

Step 5: Standard seed matchup signal
→ 11-seed vs 6-seed: Lean 11-seed (63.5% ATS since 2009)
→ 12-seed vs 5-seed: Lean 12-seed (55.96% ATS all-time)
→ All others: Follow seed-line efficiency analysis
```

### ATS Records — Updated with Efficiency Context

| Bet | Historical Record | Efficiency Filter | Filtered Record | Action |
|-----|------------------|-------------------|----------------|--------|
| All 12-seeds vs 5-seeds | 61-48-2 (55.96%) | Only 12-seeds inside top 60 KenPom | ~65%+ | Strong play |
| 11-seeds vs 6-seeds | 63.5% ATS | Power conf 11-seeds (top 40 KenPom) | ~70%+ | Auto-lean |
| Small chalk -1 to -3 (any matchup) | 39.5% ATS | No filter needed — dead zone universally | 39.5% | Never bet |
| Defense-first underdogs (AdjD top 40) | ~55% cover even in losses | All matchups | ~55–60% | Reliable ATS |
| KenPom inversions | N/A (new signal) | Lower seed outranks higher seed | **60%+ outright** | High confidence |
| R32 Cinderellas (12-15 seeds after R1 win) | 0-10 ATS since 1998 | No efficiency filter needed | 0-10 | Auto-fade |
| R32 favorites (all) | 68.75% ATS (2024) | General chalk lean | 60–65% | Moderate lean |
| R32 game totals | 63–67% Under (2021–2025) | — | Strong Under | Lean Under |

### Complete Checklist: Evaluating Any R64 Double-Digit Seed

Before betting any 10–15 seed ATS in Round of 64:

**Green Flags (bet the underdog):**
- [ ] KenPom rank inside top 60 (12-seed) or top 75 (13-seed)
- [ ] AdjD inside top 40 nationally
- [ ] AdjEM +12 or higher
- [ ] Opponent's AdjD weaker than expected for their seed
- [ ] Power conference team (often mis-seeded; not a true Cinderella)
- [ ] Balanced profile (AdjO and AdjD within 30 ranks of each other)
- [ ] Won conference tournament (momentum + familiarity with high-pressure games)
- [ ] Slow tempo (below 70 possessions/game; equalizes talent gap)
- [ ] Upperclassman-heavy roster

**Red Flags (do NOT bet the underdog):**
- [ ] KenPom rank outside top 100 for a 12-seed
- [ ] AdjD outside top 60 nationally — even with good offense
- [ ] Offense-first profile (AdjD 2× or worse than AdjO rank)
- [ ] Lost in conference tournament first round
- [ ] Weak turnover margin
- [ ] Playing a Tier 1 team (KenPom top 10, AdjEM +26+)

**If 4+ green flags:** Strong bet on underdog ATS
**If 2–3 green flags:** Lean underdog, need spread analysis (avoid -1 to -3 dead zone if it flips)
**If fewer than 2:** Fade the Cinderella narrative
