## Quick Reference — Top Findings Across All Rounds

### Why Teams Advance — Statistical

| Category | Key Finding |
|----------|-------------|
| Best Sweet 16 predictor | KenPom top 25 = ~80% Sweet 16 rate |
| Defense floor | Top 30 AdjD required — sub-top-50 defenses almost never survive two rounds |
| Champion gate | KenPom top 6 + AdjEM +25+ + AdjO top 25 + AdjD top 25 — all 6 champions met every criterion |
| Two-way requirement | Top 25 AdjO AND top 25 AdjD = championship-level profile; every champion had both |
| Why chalk dominates | Seeds 1–5 = 72.5% of Sweet 16 spots; Final Four is 54% 1-seeds — efficiency predicts |
| Dead zone (Sweet 16) | Seeds 6–9 = only 7.5% of Sweet 16 spots combined |
| 11-seed anomaly | 11-seeds appeared in Sweet 16 every single year — but nearly all are power conference mis-seeds |
| Never happened | Seeds 13–14 reached Sweet 16/Elite 8 zero times in 6 years |
| Cinderella ceiling | Defense-first: Elite 8 max / Balanced profile: Final Four possible |
| Most reliable conference | ACC: 15 Sweet 16 berths in 5 years (3.0/year avg) |
| Only mid-major lock | Gonzaga (WCC) — Sweet 16 every year studied |

### Betting Reference — ATS Data (see Appendix sections below for full data)

## Part A — Why Teams Win and Advance at Each Stage

### A1 — The Efficiency Staircase: What Each Round Requires

Each round of the tournament has a distinct efficiency floor. Teams that fail to meet the threshold for their current round exit — not because they had a bad game, but because the opponent's quality exposes structural weaknesses that worked fine against weaker competition.

| Stage | Min AdjEM | Min AdjD Rank | Min AdjO Rank | Key Differentiator |
|-------|-----------|---------------|---------------|--------------------|
| Win R64 | +8 to +10 | Any (defense helps, not required for 1 win) | Any | Single-game variance; matchup luck sufficient |
| Win R32 | +14 to +16 | Top 55 preferred | Top 55 | Preparation advantage goes to efficient teams |
| Reach Sweet 16 | +22 to +24 | **Top 40 required** | Top 35 | The steepest cliff — AdjEM must jump ~8 points from R32 |
| Reach Elite 8 | +20+ (90% of teams) | Top 30 (73%) | Top 30 (71%) | Two-way competence required; one-dimensional teams get exposed |
| Reach Final Four | +25+ | Top 17–38 documented | Top 55 | Matchup-proof efficiency; Extreme Teams cap out here |
| Win Championship | +26 to +36 | Top 25 (all 6 champions) | Top 25 (all 6 champions) | Structural advantage over every opponent in the bracket |

**The R32 → Sweet 16 cliff is the most important threshold in the bracket.** That ~8 AdjEM jump (from +14 to +22) is steeper than any other round transition. Teams in the +14 to +21 range will advance based on matchup; teams above +22 have a structural advantage.

---

### A2 — Why Chalk Dominates Each Round (And When It Doesn't)

**Why 1-4 seeds dominate**: Seeds 1–5 hold 72.5% of Sweet 16 spots, 66% of Elite 8 spots, and 54% of Final Four spots. This is not committee luck — it is efficiency correlation. The seeding committee's primary input is NET/KenPom rank, which directly predicts advancement probability. Seeds reflect the underlying data.

**Why the 6-9 dead zone exists**: Seeds 6-9 produced just 7.5% of Sweet 16 spots across 5 years — a structural bracket problem. 6-seeds face KenPom-30 11-seeds in R32. 7-seeds draw difficult R32 matchups. 8-9 seeds win a coin-flip in R1, then face a 1-seed in R32 (85-90% win rate). The path is structurally near-impossible without elite efficiency.

**Why 11-seeds appear in Sweet 16 every year**: Almost all are power conference at-large teams mis-assigned to 11 by the committee — KenPom 25-40 programs seeded low due to perception bias. Ohio State (2019), UCLA (2021, KenPom top-20), Iowa State (2022), Michigan (2022), NC State (2024, won the ACC Tournament) — these aren't Cinderellas, they're mis-seeds.

**Why chalk breaks down in specific spots**:
- **R64 5v12**: AdjEM gap averages only ~9 points — the smallest gap in the bracket below the 8/9 game. Market overvalues seeding; efficiency often shows near-parity.
- **R64 6v11**: 11-seeds cover 63.5% ATS because they're frequently better teams by efficiency. The "upset" is a seeding error being corrected.
- **R32 after Cinderella wins**: 12-15 seeds that won R1 are 0-10 ATS in R32 since 1998. The R64 win was matchup-specific; R32 opponents are prepared and better.

---

### A3 — Why Cinderellas Win (And How Far Each Type Can Go)

Three distinct reasons a lower seed beats a higher seed — and each type has a ceiling:

**Type 1 — Committee Seeding Error** (the team is legitimately stronger than their seed):
- Colorado State (12, KenPom #44) vs Memphis (5, KenPom #50) in 2025 — not an upset by efficiency
- FAU (9, KenPom #17) in 2023 — reached Final Four because they were always good enough
- NC State (11, KenPom #49) in 2024 — won the ACC Tournament, should have been seeded 6-7
- *Ceiling*: As deep as their efficiency allows — these teams were never truly Cinderellas

**Type 2 — One Elite Dimension + Vulnerable Favorite**:
- Saint Peter's (15) 2022: AdjD #28 + Kentucky's weak AdjD for a 2-seed → elite zone defense controlled 3 straight games
- Princeton (15) 2023: AdjD #13 + Arizona's perimeter shooting collapses → held Arizona to 55 pts on 4-for-25 from 3
- Oral Roberts (15) 2021: AdjO #25 + Ohio State's AdjD #79 (weak for 2-seed) → scored at will until they faced a real defense
- *Ceiling*: Elite 8 for defense-first teams; R32 for offense-only teams — the single dimension eventually faces an opponent specifically built to neutralize it

**Type 3 — Opponent Self-Destruction**:
- Abilene Christian vs Texas 2021: 23 turnovers forced by AC's pressure defense
- Yale vs Auburn 2024: 9 second-half turnovers, Auburn collapsed
- FDU vs Purdue 2023: noise event — Purdue was listed as -23.5 favorite
- *Ceiling*: R32 at most — the favorite won't self-destruct a second time

| **AdjD weak relative to seed** | 2-seed outside top 40; 3-seed outside top 50; 4-seed outside top 65 | Kentucky 2022 (2-seed, AdjD weak) → Saint Peter's; Kentucky 2024 (3-seed, AdjD #109) → Oakland; Ohio State 2021 (2-seed, AdjD #79) → Oral Roberts |
| **KenPom inversion** | Lower seed ranks higher on KenPom than higher seed | Colorado State (#44) vs Memphis (#50), 2025 — market treated as upset; efficiency said CSU was better |
| **Extreme Team flag** | Top-10 one metric, outside top-50 other | Zero championships in 22 years; 4 Final Fours in 155 appearances (2.6%) |
| **AdjEM gap under 9** | Gap between 5 and 12 seed shrinks below 9 | Upset probability climbs toward 45%+ when gap narrows to 5-6 points |
| **Turnover-prone offense vs pressure defense** | High TO rate + opponent ranks top-20 in steal rate | Texas 2021 (23 turnovers vs Abilene Christian); Auburn 2024 (9 2H turnovers vs Yale) |
| **Youth vs experienced underdog** | Freshman-heavy blue blood vs graduate-transfer underdog | Veteran rosters outperform in high-pressure elimination settings; talent gap narrows when experience matters |

### A5 — Why Champions Win: Patterns Across All 6 Years

Each champion had a structural advantage that no opponent in the bracket could neutralize:

| Year | Champion | Their Unguardable Edge | Why It Held Through 6 Games |
|------|----------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|
| 2019 | Virginia | Pack-line defense + tempo #353/353 | Compressed games to 55-60 possessions; eliminated opponents' preferred pace |
| 2021 | Baylor | Three interchangeable guard scorers + two-way efficiency | No single defensive assignment solved them; Gonzaga (AdjO #1) couldn't outscore Baylor |
| 2022 | Kansas | Depth + second-half adjustment | Down 16 in the title game; bench depth and Agbaji closing gave Self options no opponent anticipated |
| 2023 | UConn | +32 AdjEM two-way dominance | Won every game by 13+; structural efficiency advantage made individual games irrelevant |
| 2024 | UConn | +36.4 AdjEM (highest in modern era) | +140 point differential in 6 games — most dominant tournament performance ever recorded |
| 2025 | Florida | Top-4 AdjO + Top-4 AdjD + #1 FT rate nationally | Two-way excellence absorbed variance; FT rate and offensive rebounding won the 65-63 championship vs Houston's #1 defense |

**Three structural paths to a championship:**
1. **Efficiency dominance** (UConn 2023, 2024): AdjEM so high that no opponent is statistically close
2. **Two-way balance + variance absorbers** (Virginia 2019, Florida 2025): Defense controls pace; free throws and rebounding absorb the one close game every champion faces
3. **Depth + adaptability** (Kansas 2022, Baylor 2021): Multiple weapons no opponent can fully scheme for in a single game

**The unbroken gate**: KenPom top 6 + AdjO top 25 + AdjD top 25. No champion outside this profile exists in the KenPom era.

---

## Part 5 — Statistical Profile of Contenders

### Sweet 16 Statistical Thresholds

**KenPom Adjusted Efficiency:**
- Teams in the **top 25 KenPom overall** reach the Sweet 16 at ~70-80%
- Teams outside the **top 50 KenPom** almost never reach Sweet 16 regardless of seed
- Every national champion in the KenPom era ranked in the **top 10 overall**

**The "Dual Elite" Profile:**
> Top 25 adjusted offensive efficiency AND top 25 adjusted defensive efficiency
> ~80%+ Sweet 16 rate. All 6 champions fit this profile.

**Offense vs. Defense:**
- Both ends matter, but **offense has become more important** in the modern era
- All 6 champions ranked **top 15 offensively** at tournament time
- Defense is the **floor** — teams with sub-top-50 defenses rarely survive two rounds
- Defense threshold: **Top 30-40 = reliable Sweet 16 contender**
- Offense threshold: **Top 40 = Sweet 16 viable, top 50 = minimum**

**Tempo/Pace:**
- No single tempo profile dominates for power programs
- For mid-major Cinderellas: **10 of 11 teams ranked outside the top 100 in adjusted tempo**
- Slow tempo equalizes talent gaps in single-elimination games
- Optimal Cinderella range: 65-72 possessions/game

**Turnover Rate:**
- Sweet 16 teams commit turnovers on **fewer than 17% of possessions**
- Forced turnover rate is an equalizer for mid-majors — 15%+ opponent TO rate signals upset potential

### What Separates Final Four from Sweet 16 (The Delta)

| Metric | Sweet 16 Teams | Final Four Teams |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| KenPom Rank | Top 5-40 | Top 1-15 |
| AdjEM | +18 to +28 | +25 to +36 |
| AdjO Rank | 15-60 | 5-30 |
| AdjD Rank | 10-55 | 5-30 |
| Both O+D top 30 | Uncommon | Near-universal |
| Effective FG% | 20-80 | 5-40 |
| Free throw rate | Variable | Top 30 |

**7 Critical Separators (Sweet 16 → Final Four):**
1. **Two-way efficiency gap** — Final Four teams are top 20 in BOTH AdjO and AdjD
2. **AdjEM above +25** — structural breakpoint; below +20 is a long shot regardless of seed
3. **Consistent winning margin** — champions win by a lot; teams surviving close games eventually lose
4. **Free throw generation** — all 6 champions were top-25 in free throw attempt rate
5. **Interior presence or defensive scheme** — every champion had dominant paint control or comprehensive defense
6. **Schedule-tested résumé** — 23 of last 24 champions had SOS inside the top 33
7. **Proven head coach** — every 2019-2025 champion coached by a multiple-tournament-appearance veteran

## Part 6 — Top Predictors by Round

### Sweet 16 Predictors

| Rank | Stat | Threshold | Why It Matters |
|------|------|-----------|----------------|
| 1 | KenPom Overall | Top 25 = ~80% S16 rate | Best single predictor |
| 2 | Adj Defensive Efficiency | Top 30 = strong signal | Defense is the floor |
| 3 | Strength of Schedule | Top 25 SOS = strong signal | Battle-tested for elite opponents |
| 4 | Seed Line | 1-seed = 90%, 2-seed = 75-80% | Simple but powerful |
| 5 | Adj Offensive Efficiency | Top 40 = threshold | Offense increasingly important |
| 6 | Conference Membership | ACC/SEC/Big 12/Big East = positive | Filters SOS + talent |
| 7 | Turnover Rate | < 17% of possessions | Ball security = March survival |

### Final Four / Champion Predictors

| Rank | Stat | Champion Threshold | Why It Matters |
|------|------|-------------------|----------------|
| 1 | KenPom Overall | Top 6 | Hard gate — never broken |
| 2 | AdjEM | +25 minimum, +29 for champion | Structural breakpoint |
| 3 | AdjO Rank | Top 25 for champion | All 6 champions met this |
| 4 | AdjD Rank | Top 25 for champion | All 6 champions met this |
| 5 | Effective FG% | Top 20 | Champion-level signal |
| 6 | Free Throw Rate | Top 25 | Absorbs close-game variance |
| 7 | SOS Rank | Top 33 | 23 of last 24 champions |
| 8 | Seed | 1-4 only for champion | 5-seed: 0 championships in 6 years |
| 9 | Conference | ACC/Big 12/Big East/SEC | 6-for-6 championships |
| 10 | Head coach experience | Multiple tournament appearances | 6-for-6 championships |

## Part 8 — Cinderella Profile (Double-Digit Seeds)

### All Cinderellas in Sweet 16 (2019–2024)

| Year | Team | Seed | Conference | How Far | What Made Them Different |
|------|------|------|------------|---------|--------------------------|
| 2019 | Oregon | 12 | Pac-12 | Sweet 16 | Power conference — basically a mis-seed |
| 2021 | UCLA | 11 | Pac-12 | **Final Four** | Power conference at-large, top 30 KenPom |
| 2021 | Syracuse | 11 | ACC | Sweet 16 | Power conference at-large |
| 2021 | Oregon State | 12 | Pac-12 | Elite 8 | Power conference — hot streak |
| 2021 | Oral Roberts | 15 | Summit League | Sweet 16 | Elite offense, slow tempo, veteran roster |
| 2022 | Iowa State | 11 | Big 12 | Sweet 16 | Power conference at-large, top 30 KenPom |
| 2022 | Michigan | 11 | Big Ten | Sweet 16 | Power conference at-large |
| 2022 | Miami (FL) | 10 | ACC | Elite 8 | Power conference — basically a mis-seed |
| 2022 | Saint Peter's | 15 | MAAC | **Elite 8** | Elite defense, slowest tempo, veteran roster |
| 2023 | FAU | 9 | Conference USA | **Final Four** | Elite defense, KenPom top-30 both O and D |
| 2023 | Princeton | 15 | Ivy | Elite 8 | Slow tempo, veteran roster, elite turnover margin |
| 2024 | NC State | 11 | ACC | **Final Four** | Power conference at-large, DJ Burns, zone disruption |

**The 11-seed pattern:** Most are power conference at-large teams with KenPom top 30-40 — they're mis-seeded, not true Cinderellas.

**True Cinderella shared traits (non-power conference):**
- Slow tempo (outside top 100 in adjusted pace)
- Elite defense (top 30 nationally)
- Positive turnover margin
- Won conference tournament (13/19 Cinderellas since 2005)
- Upperclassman-heavy rosters (grad transfers, 4th/5th year players)
- Positive rebounding margin
- A singular scoring alpha (Oral Roberts: Max Abmas; Saint Peter's: Daryl Banks; NC State: DJ Burns)

## Part 9 — What Did NOT Predict Tournament Success

| Stat | Why It Fails |
|------|-------------|
| **Regular season win total / record** | A 28-3 weak-SOS team loses to an 18-13 ACC team consistently |
| **3-Point percentage** | Too volatile; regresses to mean quickly in March |
| **Blue Blood brand (Kansas, Kentucky, Duke, UNC)** | 2023: None made the Sweet 16. Brand is priced into lines already. |
| **Margin of victory in regular season** | Does not transfer to tournament vs elite opponents |
| **Offensive rebounding rate alone** | Only useful as part of the Four Factors, not standalone |
| **Name recognition of coach** | Upsets happen to elite coaches regularly |
| **High-volume 3PT offense (40%+ shots from 3)** | Boom-or-bust; most consistent teams take mid-range 3PT volume |
| **Pace (for power programs)** | Both fast and slow power programs make Final Fours |
