## Part 2 — Cross-Year Trend Analysis

### Seed Distribution (80 total Sweet 16 spots across 5 years)

| Seed | Count | % of Slots | Notes |
|------|-------|------------|-------|
| 1 | 18 | 22.5% | 90% rate — most reliable |
| 2 | 13 | 16.3% | 75-80% rate |
| 3 | 12 | 15.0% | ~50% rate |
| 4 | 8 | 10.0% | |
| 5 | 7 | 8.8% | |
| 6 | 2 | 2.5% | Dead zone begins |
| 7 | 1 | 1.3% | |
| 8 | 2 | 2.5% | |
| 9 | 1 | 1.3% | |
| 10 | 1 | 1.3% | |
| **11** | **5** | **6.3%** | **Best Cinderella seed — every year** |
| 12 | 2 | 2.5% | |
| 13 | 0 | 0% | Never happened in 5 years |
| 14 | 0 | 0% | Never happened in 5 years |
| 15 | 3 | 3.8% | Oral Roberts (2021), Saint Peter's (2022), Princeton (2023) |

- **Seeds 1–5 = 72.5% of all Sweet 16 spots**
- **Seeds 6–9 = dead zone (7.5% combined)**
- **11-seed appeared every single year** — the most predictable Cinderella seed
- **13 and 14 seeds have NEVER made the Sweet 16** in these 5 years

### Conference Totals (5 Years)

| Conference | 2019 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | Total | Avg/Yr |
|------------|------|------|------|------|------|-------|--------|
| ACC | 5 | 2 | 3 | 1 | 4 | **15** | 3.0 |
| SEC | 4 | 2 | 1 | 3 | 2 | **12** | 2.4 |
| Big 12 | 1 | 1 | 3 | 3 | 2 | **10** | 2.0 |
| Big East | 0 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 3 | **10** | 2.0 |
| Big Ten | 3 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | **9** | 1.8 |
| Pac-12 | 1 | 4 | 2 | 1 | 1 | **9** | 1.8 |
| WCC (Gonzaga) | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | **5** | 1.0 |
| American Athletic | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 0.6 |
| Mountain West | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 0.4 |
| Mid-Major/Other | 0 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 7 | 1.4 |

**Key takeaways:**
- ACC is the single most reliable conference — avg 3 teams per year
- Big East has risen sharply (0 in 2019 → 3 in 2023 and 2024)
- Gonzaga is the ONLY non-power program to make the Sweet 16 every year studied
- Power 5 conferences (ACC + SEC + Big 12 + Big East + Big Ten) account for **56 of 80 spots (70%)**
- Pac-12's 2021 explosion (4 teams) was a clear outlier — normally 1-2/year

### Statistical Profile of Sweet 16 Teams

**KenPom Adjusted Efficiency:**
- Teams ranked in the **top 25 KenPom overall** reach the Sweet 16 at ~70-80% rate
- Teams outside the **top 50 KenPom** almost never reach Sweet 16 regardless of seed
- Every national champion in the KenPom era ranked in the **top 10 overall**

**The "Dual Elite" Profile — strongest combined signal:**
> Top 25 adjusted offensive efficiency AND top 25 adjusted defensive efficiency
> ~80%+ Sweet 16 rate. 5 of the past 10 champions fit this profile.

**Offense vs. Defense:**
- Both ends matter, but **offense has become more important** in the modern era
- All 5 champions (Virginia 2019, Baylor 2021, Kansas 2022, UConn 2023, UConn 2024) ranked **top 15 offensively** at tournament time
- Defense is the **floor** — teams with sub-top-50 defenses rarely survive two rounds regardless of offense
- Threshold for defense: **Top 30-40 = reliable Sweet 16 contender**
- Threshold for offense: **Top 40 = Sweet 16 viable, top 50 = minimum**

**Tempo/Pace:**
- No single tempo profile dominates for power programs — fast and slow teams both succeed
- For mid-major Cinderellas: **10 of 11 teams ranked outside the top 100 in adjusted tempo**
  - Slow tempo equalizes talent gaps in single-elimination games
  - Optimal balanced range: 65-72 possessions/game
  - Fast-tempo mid-majors (75+) have significantly worse Cinderella profiles

**Turnover Rate:**
- Sweet 16 teams consistently commit turnovers on **fewer than 17% of possessions**
- Forced turnover rate (steal rate) is an equalizer for mid-majors — teams that create 15%+ opponent TO rate have outsized upset potential
- Ball security is **critical** — March opponents scout intensely and pressure the ball

**3-Point Shooting — what the data says:**
- 3PT% is **too volatile** to rely on as a Sweet 16 predictor
- High-volume 3PT teams (40%+ of shots from deep) are boom-or-bust
- **3PT defense** (limiting opponent attempts, not just %) is more predictive
- Most consistent Sweet 16 teams: mid-range 3PT volume, high 2PT efficiency

## Part 3 — Top 7 Predictors of Sweet 16 Appearance

| Rank | Stat | Threshold | Why It Matters |
|------|------|-----------|----------------|
| 1 | **KenPom Overall Rank** | Top 25 = ~80% S16 rate | Best single predictor available |
| 2 | **Adjusted Defensive Efficiency** | Top 30 = strong signal | Defense is the floor — weak D teams don't survive |
| 3 | **Strength of Schedule** | Top 25 SOS = strong signal | Highest single-stat correlator; battle-tested for elite opponents |
| 4 | **Seed Line** | 1-seed = 90%, 2-seed = 75-80%, 11-seed surprisingly high | Simple but powerful |
| 5 | **Adjusted Offensive Efficiency** | Top 40 = threshold | Offense increasingly important in modern era |
| 6 | **Conference Membership** | ACC/SEC/Big 12/Big East = positive signal | Filters SOS + talent in one variable |
| 7 | **Turnover Rate** | < 17% of possessions | Ball security = March survival |

## Part 4 — ATS Edges

### Best Bets Identified

| Edge | Record | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Fade 5+ pt Sweet 16 favorites** | 7-15 ATS (31.8%) since 2017 | Biggest market inefficiency in the tournament |
| **Back 4-6 pt Sweet 16 underdogs** | 38-29-1 ATS (56.7%) since 1990 | Most durable trend in March Madness |
| **All Sweet 16 underdogs** | 49-36-1 ATS (57.6%) since 2011 | Consistent cross-year edge |
| **11-seeds vs 6-seeds (R64)** | 33-19 ATS (63.5%) since 2009 | Best first-round underdog play |
| **1-seeds in Sweet 16** | 16-8-1 ATS (66.7%) since 2014 | Still covers even as big favorites |
| **Avoid small chalk R64 (-1 to -3)** | 43-66-4 ATS (39.5%) since 2009 | Worst segment to bet in all of March |
| **Fade R1 Cinderellas in R32** | 0-10 ATS since 1998 | 12-15 seeds that won R1 always fail to cover R2 |
| **Under in R64 + R32** | ~67% in 2023 | Tournament slows pace; coaching gets conservative |

### ATS by Round Summary

| Round | Best Play | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| R64 (Round of 64) | Lean underdogs, fade small chalk | Underdogs 52.8% ATS since 2015 |
| R32 (Round of 32) | Lean chalk | Favorites 68.75% ATS in 2024; Cinderellas 0-10 ATS since 1998 |
| Sweet 16 | Back moderate underdogs (4-6 pts) | 56.7% ATS since 1990; fade 5+ pt favorites |
| Elite Eight | Similar to Sweet 16 — fade large favorites | Market overvalues top seeds in second weekend |

## Part 5 — Cinderella Profile (Double-Digit Seeds)

**12 double-digit seeds reached the Sweet 16 across 5 years:**

| Year | Team | Seed | Conference | What Made Them Different |
|------|------|------|------------|--------------------------|
| 2019 | Oregon | 12 | Pac-12 | Power conference — basically a mis-seed |
| 2021 | UCLA | 11 | Pac-12 | Power conference at-large — top 30 KenPom |
| 2021 | Syracuse | 11 | ACC | Power conference at-large |
| 2021 | Oregon State | 12 | Pac-12 | Power conference — hot streak |
| 2021 | Oral Roberts | 15 | Summit League | Elite offense, slow tempo, veteran roster |
| 2022 | Iowa State | 11 | Big 12 | Power conference at-large — top 30 KenPom |
| 2022 | Michigan | 11 | Big Ten | Power conference at-large |
| 2022 | Miami (FL) | 10 | ACC | Power conference — basically a mis-seed |
| 2022 | Saint Peter's | 15 | MAAC | Elite defense, slowest tempo in field, veteran roster |
| 2023 | FAU | 9 | Conference USA | Elite defense, peaked at tournament, SOS was weak |
| 2023 | Princeton | 15 | Ivy | Slow tempo, veteran roster, elite turnover margin |
| 2024 | NC State | 11 | ACC | Power conference at-large — went to Final Four |

**The 11-seed pattern:** Most are power conference at-large teams with legitimate KenPom top 30-40 rankings — they're mis-seeded, not true Cinderellas.

**True Cinderella shared traits (non-power conference):**
- Slow tempo (outside top 100 in adjusted pace)
- Elite defense (top 30 nationally)
- Positive turnover margin
- Won conference tournament (13/19 Cinderellas since 2005)
- Upperclassman-heavy rosters (grad transfers, 4th/5th year players)
- Positive rebounding margin

## Part 6 — What Did NOT Predict Sweet 16 Appearance

| Stat | Why It Fails |
|------|-------------|
| **Regular season win total / record** | A 28-3 weak-SOS team loses to an 18-13 ACC team consistently |
| **3-Point percentage** | Too volatile; regresses to mean quickly in March |
| **Blue Blood brand (Kansas, Kentucky, Duke, UNC)** | 2023: None of these programs made the Sweet 16. Brand is already priced into lines. |
| **Margin of victory in regular season** | Does not transfer to tournament vs elite opponents |
| **Offensive rebounding rate alone** | Only useful as part of the Four Factors package, not standalone |
| **Name recognition of coach** | Upsets happen to elite coaches regularly |

## Part 7 — Recommended Features for a Betting Model

### Tier 1 — Core Features (Highest Impact)
1. **KenPom Overall Rank** — numerical input; top 25 threshold flag
2. **Adjusted Defensive Efficiency Rank** — binary: top 30 = 1
3. **Strength of Schedule (NET SOS)** — top 25 flag; essential for mid-major evaluation
4. **Seed Line** — direct input; 1-seed, 2-seed, and 11-seed deserve special flags
5. **Adjusted Offensive Efficiency Rank** — top 40 threshold

### Tier 2 — Secondary Features
6. **Turnover Rate** (< 17% of possessions = positive signal)
7. **Conference membership flags** — ACC/SEC/Big 12/Big East/Big Ten = positive
8. **Tempo flag for mid-majors** — < 70 possessions/game = Cinderella-friendly
9. **Conference tournament result** — champion or finalist = momentum signal
10. **Dual Elite boolean** — top 25 offense AND top 25 defense = championship contender

### Tier 3 — ATS-Specific Triggers
11. **Spread size** — 5+ in Sweet 16 = fade alert; 4-6 = underdog signal; 1-3 in R64 = avoid
12. **Round context** — R64 lean underdogs → R32 lean chalk → S16 lean underdogs
13. **11-seed flag vs 6-seed** — auto lean underdog
14. **Cinderella R2 fade flag** — if opponent won R1 as 12-15 seed, fade them in R2
15. **3PT volume flag** — 40%+ of shots from 3 = high-variance, avoid on totals
